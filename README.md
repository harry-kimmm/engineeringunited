# Engineering United Website
##  [Link Here](https://harry-kimmm.github.io/engineeringunited/)
This repo holds the static website for my club at Cypress High School, Engineering United.
I decided to build this using HTML/CSS along with bootstrap components from MIT.
I see this long-term project as an opportunity to work with others and practice communicating and implementing feature requests.
